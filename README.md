# Delta-Assistant
Hi <br/>
I'm Phoenix <br/>
This project is a smart assistant <br/>
This is the 1.0 version of this project <br/>
I am currently working on the third version of this project <br/>
This app currently only supports typed commands <br/>
I am writing this program to help me and anyone who uses it get things done faster <br/>

# MPD Pattern
I used a new pattern in coding this artificial intelligence <br/>
MPD pattern: <br/>
This pattern has three layers <br/>
Modules: Libraries and Functions <br/>
Processors: processing instructions (for example: conditional statements) <br/>
Databases: application data <br/>
In the next update, documentation of this pattern will be published <br/>

# Features 1.0
Features of this version of Delta Assistant: <br/>
>Semi-rigid calculations in mathematics, physics, chemistry <br/>
>Search engines <br/>
>Search Wikipedia <br/>
>Open a URL <br/>
>Open a project from your system <br/>
>Rename the file or folder <br/>
>Analyze a stock (this is not yet complete in this version) <br/>
>Alert for currency or stock price fluctuations <br/>

# Features 1.3
Below you can see the latest capabilities of this artificial intelligence: <br/>
>Heavy calculations in mathematics, physics, chemistry <br/>
>Search in search engines and choose the best result <br/>
>Search Wikipedia by returning a summary of your topic <br/>
>Open a URL <br/>
>Open a project from your system <br/>
>Rename the file or folder <br/>
>And the analysis of a stock you send the previous price of that stock to the DA and it analyzes and analyzes it for you and instead tells you whether to buy or not. This is done by a complex neural network. This neural network makes every effort to analyze. If it was difficult for you to tell the stock history, you can leave it to the DA. It even tells you how much to buy. You can have a list of stocks. Give it to DA to tell you what to do with that stock! For example, it tells you to sell some of your stock.
>Alert for currency or stock price fluctuations <br/>
>Convert audio file to text file <br/>
>Convert image to PDF <br/>
>Convert PDF to image <br/>
>Convert video to text <br/>
>Convert text files to combinations <br/>
>Convert all audio files together <br/>
>Convert all video files together <br/>
>Search social networks to track people <br/>
>Get the latest world news <br/>
>A new feature of this artificial intelligence is that you can make voice commands from yourself <br/>
And hundreds of other features ... <br/>

Of course these features are for version 1.3 <br/>
